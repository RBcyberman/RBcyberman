# Attention! You are onboarding R.L's cyber cruise 🤖🖥️🚀👨‍🚀 

**`Aspiring cybersecurity analyst and practitioner`**

It's been a wild ride. You might roll your eyes and think, "Ah, another tech enthusiast," but hear me out. The way to safeguard our digital lives is changing faster than my socks, and I'm all here for it. Diving into puzzles and chasing down virtual villains in capture-the-flag or threat-hunting games is my kind of party. Constant learning is also my jam in this never-ending realm of cybersecurity. Think of me as a mini Geronimo Stilton of the internet, just with more caffeine and fewer tweed jackets.

  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 R.L's Cyber Journey</h3></summary>
   Confession time: I spent four years wrangling IT/AV/Security systems for clients – think spreadsheets and troubleshooting galore. Don't get me wrong, it was engaging, but the world of cybersecurity always held a magnetic pull. So, I took a deep dive with a post-graduate degree in cybersecurity. It was a year of intense learning – firewalls became fortresses, encryption a secret language, and vulnerability assessments my detective work. Certifications like Security+, CCNA, and Microsoft creds were my badges of honour, but the real reward is the constant learning curve. Now, I'm on a mission to become a cybersecurity Swiss Army Knife – cloud security, network defences, you name it! Every new concept feels like unlocking another level in this digital adventure. Fresh out of school, I wouldn't call myself a cybersecurity guru (yet!), but I'm a fast learner with a thirst for knowledge and a genuine passion for safeguarding the digital landscape.  I'm eager to contribute my growing skillset to a team and learn from the best.  Let's join forces and be the ultimate defence against those lurking digital nasties!
